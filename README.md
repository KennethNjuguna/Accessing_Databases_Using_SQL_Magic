Descriptions:-

# <h2>These are Labs included in the course 'Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python' </h2> 
<ul>
  
<b> <li> Accessing databases using SQL magic. </li> </b>
<p>-Acessing SQL databases from within a notebook, we use SQL 'magic' provided by the ipython-sql extension</p>
<p>-Commands begin with '%'</p>
<p>-For convenience, we can use %%sql (two %'s instead of one) at the top of a cell to indicate we want the entire cell to be treated as SQL. Let's use this to create a table and fill it with some test data for experimenting.</p>
