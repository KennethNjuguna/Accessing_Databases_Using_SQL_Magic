<p>Acessing SQL databases from within a notebook, we use SQL 'magic' provided by the ipython-sql extension</p>
<p>Commands begin with '%'</p>
<p>For convenience, we can use %%sql (two %'s instead of one) at the top of a cell to indicate we want the entire cell to be treated as SQL. Let's use this to create a table and fill it with some test data for experimenting.</p>
